## How to Run

1. download both the [tem_frontend](https://github.com/MoppetX/TEM_frontend 'the frontend') && [tem_backend](https://github.com/MoppetX/TEM_backend 'the other end') repos
2. move the `docker-compose.yml` file (exists in both repos) up a level
3. run `time docker-compose up -d`

This will one day be a fully fleshed out recipe & menu creation App (_hopefully_).
There are two basic ideas behind it:

### 1. Improving cooking skills through iteration

There are enough recipe sites/apps out there already. While they let you create, share, and import recipes, a functionality I have sorely missed so far is the ability to create a version history for a specific recipe you've created/imported, to enable you test and tweak a recipe until you've perfected it. In essence, a git for recipes which helps you improve your cooking more efficiently.

### 2. Easily generating/maintaining an 'Eternal Menu'

I am assuming that some people don't want to try out new recipes every week, but instead would want to build up a cook book filled with favourites they know they can cook well. The next step then is to help users create weekly/biweekly menus from their recipe collections.
